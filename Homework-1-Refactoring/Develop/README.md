# Homework-1-Refactoring
First homework assignment. Refactoring

This website is an advertizing agency that helps businesses have more accessibility in their websites. Being that accessibility is what they offer, it is important that they themselves have this on their website. 

Our User Story for this project is to refactor a marketing agencies website to be better optimized for search engines.
Here is the user story given.

Nothing to the website's image will change with the code changes we make. The benefit of these changes will be strictly for accessibility purposes.
This is the current look of the website, which once again, will not change in design.

Several divs and classes had to be taken out and replaced with more semantic tags. Having more semantic tags will give this site more accessibility. Search engines will know that these semantic tags are more important.  This will cause less issues or errors than having divs and classes.
Before with div and class:

After using main and sections:

Of course by doing this all css selectors will be changed from the class selectors that they had to the more semantic tags given.
