# Homework-1-Refactoring
First homework assignment. Refactoring

This website is an advertizing agency that helps businesses have more accessibility in their websites. Being that accessibility is what they offer, it is important that they themselves have this on their website. 

Our User Story for this project is to refactor a marketing agencies website to be better optimized for search engines.
Here is the user story given.

Nothing to the website's image will change with the code changes we make. The benefit of these changes will be strictly for accessibility purposes.
This is the current look of the website, which once again, will not change in design.
